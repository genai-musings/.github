# genai-musings - README.md

Recently we spent sometime spent experimenting with a number of generative AI text, image and video creation tools including ChatGPT, D-ID Studio, Dall-E and Bing Image Creator via the API interfaces they provide.

We are now sharing the results of those experiments through this, the [genai-musings](https://github.com/genai-musings) GitHub organization. The [genai-musings](https://github.com/genai-musings) organization includes a number of sample repositories containing "bare bones" examples, each illustrating how to make a single API call to an AI tool and how to process the response.

- [chatting-with-ChatGPT](https://github.com/genai-musings/chatting-with-ChatGPT)

- [creating-with-BingImageCreator](https://github.com/genai-musings/creating-with-BingImageCreator) (archived)

- [dallying-with-DALL-E](https://github.com/genai-musings/dallying-with-DALL-E)

- [dawdling-with-D-ID](https://github.com/genai-musings/dawdling-with-D-ID)

Each repository also includes:

- GitHub CI Actions to lint, validate and test any code submitted before it is merged.

- GitHub CD Action to build and deploy a docker image containing the respective sample applications.

Note: The sample applications require accounts, keys and in some cases credits for the respective AI tools. Details as to what is required for each sample application is specified in the README.md files of the individual repositories.

Finally as a common pattern emerged when creating the [genai-musings](https://github.com/genai-musings) repositories, this organization also contains a GitHub Template Repository - [template-repo-template](https://github.com/genai-musings/template-repo-template). This is a Python template repository intended for use if and when creating similar repositories for other AI tools or indeed when creating new Python repositories.

Feel free to browse the code, to make a contribution by submitting a pull request, to ask a question or report a bug by opening an issue in the relevant [genai-musings](https://github.com/genai-musings) GitHub repository.
